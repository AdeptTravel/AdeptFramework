<h2>European Ports in 2023: Cruise Ship Changes Amid Environmental Concerns</h2>
<p>As the <a href="/types/cruise" title="Cruise">Cruise</a> industry recuperates post-pandemic, several European ports are rethinking the admittance of large cruise ships due to overtourism and environmental concerns. Data from 2022 highlighted that <a href="/types/european-cruise" title="European Cruise">European Cruise</a> ships produced harmful pollutants at alarming rates. Notable destinations such as Venice banned large cruise ships, aiming to protect its heritage sites. With alternatives limited, many ships continue to dock there. Other European cities, such as Barcelona, Marseille, and Amsterdam, are also implementing measures to curb overtourism and pollution. As a consequence, cruise-goers might need to reconsider travel plans or seek different travel methods. Despite these challenges, some cruise lines aim for net-zero emissions by 2050, indicating adaptability.</p>
